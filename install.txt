To install pfff, you must first install recent versions of:
 - OCaml (at least 4.02.3)
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - SWI-prolog
   if you want the interactive code query tool
 - Java (for bddbddb)
   if you want the datalog pointer analysis

If you want most of the good things just type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make opt

This should generate a few binaries at the toplevel directory such
as pfff.
