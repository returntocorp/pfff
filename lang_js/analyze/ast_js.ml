(* A (real) Abstract Syntax Tree for Javascript, not a Concrete Syntax Tree
 * as in cst_js.ml.
 * 
 * This file contains a simplified Javascript AST. The original
 * Javascript syntax tree (cst_js.ml) is good for code refactoring or
 * code visualization; the types used matches exactly the source. However,
 * for other algorithms, the nature of the CST makes the code a bit
 * redundant. Hence the idea of a real and simplified AST 
 * where certain constructions have been factorized or even removed.
 *
 * Here is a list of the simplications/factorizations:
 *  - no purely syntactical tokens in the AST like parenthesis, brackets,
 *    braces, angles, commas, semicolons, etc. No ParenExpr.
 *    The only token information kept is for identifiers for error reporting.
 *    See 'wrap' below.
 *    update: we actually keep the different kinds of brackets for sgrep, but
 *    they are all agglomerated in a general 'bracket' type. 
 *  - no types (but could revisit this decision)
 *  - no Typescript (no interface)
 *  - no U, B, Yield, Await, Seq, ... just Apply (and Special Id)
 *  - no field vs method. A method is just sugar to define
 *    a field with a lambda (some people even uses directly that forms
 *    thx to arrows).
 *  - old: no Period vs Bracket (actually good to differentiate)
 *  - old: no Object vs Array (actually good to differentiate)
 *  - no func vs method vs arrow, just fun_
 *  - no class elements vs object elements
 *  - No Nop (EmptyStmt); transformed in an empty Block,
 *  - no patterns (they are transpiled, see transpile_js.ml, unless
 *    Ast_js_build.transpile_pattern is false)
 *  - no JSX (see transpile_js.ml, unless Ast_js_build.transpile_xml is false)
 *  - no ForOf (see transpile_js.ml)
 *  - no ExportDefaultDecl, ExportDefaultExpr, just unsugared in
 *    separate variable declarations and an Export name
 *    (using 'default_entity' special name)
 * 
 * todo:
 *  - add back type information? useful for many analysis! 
 *    useful for semgrep for typescript!
 *  - add decorators (also useful for semgrep) 
 *  - ast_js_es5.ml? unsugar even more? remove classes, get/set, etc.?
 *  - unsugar ES6 features? lift Var up, rename lexical vars, etc.
